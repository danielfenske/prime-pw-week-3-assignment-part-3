      Fun fact: The background color used in Week 3 Assignment Part 3, called "Very Peri," was
      introduced by Pantone as a brand-new shade of purple for 2022. According to Pantone, "the dynamic
      periwinkle blue boasts a warm violet-red undertone and signals novelty in these, yes <i>still</i>,
      unprecendeted times."
